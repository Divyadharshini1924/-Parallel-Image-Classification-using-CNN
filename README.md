# -Parallel-Image-Classification-using-CNN
This repository demonstrates an implementation of parallel image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project explores how CNNs can be structured to process image data in parallel, enhancing computational efficiency and enabling experimentation with various filter sizes and layer configurations for improved accuracy.
